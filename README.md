# OOPs Notes

This repository contains my personal notes on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** concepts.  
It includes explanations, examples, and code snippets covering topics like:

- Classes & Objects  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Abstraction  
- Encapsulation  
- Static & Dynamic Binding  
- Constructors  
- Overloading & Overriding  
- And more...

These notes are meant to help in revision, interview preparation, and understanding core OOP concepts in depth.

Feel free to explore and suggest improvements!
